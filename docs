"Ad hoc package manager"

adhoc-packagem.pl

A Perl tool that "installs" files from a directory and then helps removing them all.

PARAMETERS (see USAGE below, too)
inst [-p] source_dir [-r root_path] [-file output]
del [-p] input.insfile [-r root_path]
-h
--help

PREFACE
Currently it's not very smart, but it does the job.
It does no proper check whether the source and destination paths are meaningful
(for example it does not check if real path of source and destination are
different:
./adhoc-packagem.pl inst bla -r ./bla
info: source is: bla
info: destination is: /home/(some path here)adhoc-packagem/./bla/
Error, file bla.insfiles already exists.
Have you already installed the files somewhere?
- like this).
See also SPECIAL FILES and OTHER INFO for more details.

USAGE
Arguments must occur after source directory (inst) or .insfile (del).
Argument -p is the only exception (for example, inst -p source_dir
and inst source_dir -p are permitted).

* -h (or --help)
Prints some blah - informations and usage. If you are reading this file you
don't need this.

* inst
inst [-p] source_dir [-r root_path] [-file output]
Copy files from source_dir to root_path, or / if root_path is not specified.
Use -file output to speficy output .insfile (extension will be appended if necessary).
Default .insfile is: root_path.insfile, for example /tmp/dir.insfile for /tmp/dir.

* del
del [-p] input.insfile [-r root_path]
Reads input.insfile and removes files and non-empty directories in reversed order.
If you specify -r root_path, it will be appended to all items. This could
be useful if you work with chroots. Use -p to see what resulting paths would look
like.
Note: additional -file input2.insfile is permitted and will override input.insfile.

If used multiple -file arg or -r arg, the last one will be used.

PURPOSE
It can be used when you want to copy directory with some app to /usr/local
(or even /usr or /; the destination path "/" is the default) and then remove
it easily.

SPECIAL FILES
A note about non-regular files on "inst".
Symbolic links: a new symbolic link is made in the destination directory, and new
symlink's "content" (where it points to) is exactly the same as of the original one.
Note it doesn't mean the new symbolic link will always point to the same
item in a filesystem - it means only that, for example, "../xyz" will be "../xyz".
Another special files are ignored and a warning is issued.
There's no attempt to change owner, group or permissions for a symbolic link.

OTHER INFO
* inst
It tries to operate safely. If a file already exists it won't be overwritten
(in such a case it'll abort - all changes can be undone with "del" command).
However, if a directory (or a symbolic link that points to a directory) already
exists, it will be used. Such a directory (or symbolic link) won't be removed
with "del" option.
It tries to change mode (writable, executable etc.) of created item to match the
original one's mode (note: not for symbolic links; not for directories that already
exist). On success, tries to set the same UID and GID, too (same note as above).
If any of these two operations fail, a warning is issued, but the process
is not aborted.
Access or modification time of created item is set as-is (usually it will be
"now"). 
If a file cannot be copied or a symbolic link cannot be made, a message is
printed on screen and the process is aborted.

* del
Currently it does not check if file was modified in any way after installing with
this tool, and removes it when using "del" option anyway.
When removing directories it uses the rmdir function, that will refuse to
delete non-empty directory. It is good and intended! (A non-empty directory
occurs if something was added to it after "installing" with this tool.)
If an item was already removed, a warning is issued.

PRETEND MODE
Pretend mode (-p) is a simple way to check of what would be done.
* with "inst":
- generates a .insfile,
- checks if there are any conflicts ("If a file already exists it won't be
overwritten" above),
- does not check for permissions or another problems that can occur during copying;

* with "del":
- reads a .insfile (with normal check if it's OK),
- writes what file (or maybe directory - see below) would be removed,
- if such a file/directory does not exist anymore, tells user about it,
- a non-empty directory would not be removed, but in this mode user won't be
notified about this fact.
